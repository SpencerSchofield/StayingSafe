This was my dissertation project completed during my final year at university. It was an application created using Flutter and Dart. It was a safety application for students primarily females. The inital commit included all the code completed by the end of university.
The goal of the app was to allow students on campus to send an alarm out to specific contacts when they feel unsafe, we wanted to make this app as our campus has a well known path along a hill which is known for being a bad at certain times of the day.
